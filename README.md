# SCAP STIG Viewer and Hardening

A Github repository of code to harden a Windows and a Linux system while being compliant to SCAP

## Compile/Deploy: 
I would prefer powershell for Windows as it is universal for all windows systems including Windows 10, 11 and Windows Servers 2019. Linux I would like to use Bash if at all possible as is universal for all Linux systems.

## Usage:
This can be used as a baseline for the CSU cybersecurity team for their competitions in accordinance to the DoD SCAP tool available on public.cyber.mil

## Options:
SCAP was the main tool used, with CIS as a backup. SCAP was ultimately chosen as its accordince to DoD standard as well as a familiarty with the application as well as the detailed reports that SCAP gives.

## Testing
Testing for this project will be done through the CSCI networks with a remote desktop connection or an SSH connection through RustDesk.

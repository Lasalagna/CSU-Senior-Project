ID number: 497-08 (Repository)
Type:Look and Feel
Description A GitHub repository separated into sections based upon the code, the operating system as well as what the code will do. The password policy code will be separate from the audit policy code for both systems.
Rationale: Completing the foundation gives the motivation to push through and work harder on everything else in the project.
Fit Criterion: It is the foundation for all the other requirements in this project.
Priority: This step is already complete and the GitHub repository has been made but the priority would either be first thing completed or one of the last things completed.
Dependencies: None

ID number: 497-09 (SCAP report)
Type: Security and Usability
Description: This is the SCAP report for both systems that tell what the system(s) do correctly according to the Department of Defense’s security policies vs what they do incorrectly.
Rationale: getting this part complete gets me to the ability to develop the code needed and fill the GitHub repository with working code after the tests are complete.
Fit Criterion: This allows for Longevity as well as Reliability with safety being the first point from the SCAP report and the DoD’s mission.
Priority: High priority as this gives me a report that I can present on as well as code everything with exact parameters. Completion halfway there (working on linux SCAP download).
Dependencies: None
ID number: 497-10-18
Type: Usability and performance
Description: this is the windows code with separation of the code into segments for the firewall, password policies, audit policy, registry editor, windows defender and antivirus, local security policy, windows update services, and the users group and policies hence the place of requirements 10-18. The code will be well documented with comments and should follow the most updated syntax of powershell.
Rationale: this is a big chunk of the project hence the high requirement count and will take a majority of my time outside of developing the presentation wrapping everything up. The table below will help track progress
Fit Criterion: Reliability and safety critical as it uses the DoD standard with SCAP allowing for a hardened system through the SCAP roadmap below.
Priority: High as this is the majority of the project.

ID number: 497-19-27
Type: Usability and performance
Description: this is the linux code that will follow the bash script syntax to allow for ease of use during the project.
Rationale: this is a big chunk of the project hence the high requirement count and will take a majority of my time outside of developing the presentation wrapping everything up.
Fit Criterion: Reliability and safety critical as it uses the DoD standard with SCAP allowing for a hardened system through the SCAP roadmap below.

ID number 497-99 (Presentation)
Type: Cultural
Description: This is the google slides presentation regarding the project itself, any issues in the project as well as ways to circumvent admin privileges in the system(s).
Rationale: this will put words and pictures into the project allowing for a better understanding of any issues and how they were fixed and how the project was formed.
